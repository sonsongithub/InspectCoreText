Totally agree, don't read too much into my comment I'm happy it's paid. I personally have seen many tech companies - funded and unfunded - try to get away with unpaid interns. My point here is it is refreshing to see this :)
Personally, I don't believe in the whole intern thing beyond hiring someone out of university, but that's personal opinion. What's the name of that data science training school in NYC that only accepts A-grade candidates at a small attendance of 20+ per class and only requests tuition after placement? It seems like a good model.
